Features
----------------------------------------------

BiblioPixel has some snappy features:


* It runs on the Raspberry Pi, Windows, MacOS and Linux.

* It has drivers for almost every popular LED strip, and many other lights.

* Lighting Projects can be put together without any programming...

* ...and it's easy to reuse projects...

* ...but if you program, it's also easy to write your own Animations, Controls,
  Drivers and Layouts in Python,

* ...or there's a Project Builder to let you experiment from the command line.

* There's a fast and free `WebGL visualizer <http://simpixel.io>`_ driver,

* ...and a REST Control...

* ...and you can also make animated GIFs to send to your friends.

* BiblioPixel uses high-performance `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
  arithmetic...

* ...but plays nicely with plain old Python lists (and classic BiblioPixel
  code).

* There are Controls like REST, MIDI and keyboard that can control any
  animation, layout, device or other control â€“ also without programming.

* There are color Palettes you can share between Animations and Projects, and
  also modulate using Controls.

* ...and much more.
